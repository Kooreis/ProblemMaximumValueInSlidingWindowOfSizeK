# Question: How do you find the maximum value in each sliding window of size k? C# Summary

The provided C# code is designed to find the maximum value in each sliding window of size k in an array. The main function initializes an array and a window size, then calls the MaxSlidingWindow function, which returns an array of maximum values for each sliding window. This result is then printed to the console. The MaxSlidingWindow function uses a LinkedList as a double-ended queue (deque) to keep track of indices of the elements in the array. It iterates over the array, and for each element, it removes indices from the front of the deque if they are out of the current window's bounds, and from the back if the corresponding elements are less than the current one. Then it adds the current index to the back of the deque. If the current index is at least k-1, it adds the first element in the deque (which is the maximum of the current window) to the result array. This way, the function efficiently finds the maximum value in each sliding window of size k in the array.

# Python Differences

Both the C# and Python versions solve the problem using a similar approach. They both use a deque (double-ended queue) to keep track of the indices of the elements in the current window. The deque is maintained in such a way that the first element is always the maximum in the current window.

The main differences between the two versions are due to the differences in the languages themselves:

1. Input: In the C# version, the array and window size are hard-coded, while in the Python version, they are taken as input from the user.

2. Syntax: Python uses indentation to denote blocks of code, while C# uses braces {}. Python uses 'def' to define a function, while C# uses 'public static'. Python uses 'len' to get the length of an array, while C# uses 'Length'. Python uses 'append' to add an element to the end of a list, while C# uses 'AddLast'. Python uses 'popleft' and 'pop' to remove an element from the start and end of a deque, while C# uses 'RemoveFirst' and 'RemoveLast'.

3. Null/None check: The C# version checks if the input array is null or of length 0 and returns an empty array in such cases. The Python version checks if the length of the array is less than the window size and returns -1 in such cases.

4. Output: The C# version stores the maximum values in an array and prints them in the Main method, while the Python version stores them in a list and prints them in the main function.

5. Type conversion: In Python, the input is taken as a string and then converted to a list of integers and an integer. In C#, the input is already in the desired types.

6. Python uses list comprehension for creating the array from user input, which is a feature not available in C#. 

7. Python uses the 'if __name__ == "__main__":' construct to allow or prevent parts of code from being run when the modules are imported.

# Java Differences

Both the C# and Java versions solve the problem using a similar approach. They both use a Deque (double-ended queue) to keep track of the indices of the elements in the current window of size k. The Deque is maintained in such a way that the front of the Deque always contains the index of the maximum element in the current window.

The main differences between the two versions are:

1. Language Syntax: The C# version uses C# specific syntax and the Java version uses Java specific syntax. For example, the C# version uses `LinkedList<int>` for the Deque while the Java version uses `Deque<Integer>`.

2. Output: The C# version stores the maximum values in an array and returns it, while the Java version prints the maximum values directly to the console.

3. Error Checking: The C# version includes a check at the beginning of the `MaxSlidingWindow` method to return an empty array if the input array is null or empty. The Java version does not include this check.

4. Loop Structure: The C# version uses a single for loop to iterate over the array, while the Java version uses two separate for loops. The first loop in the Java version is used to process the first k elements, and the second loop is used to process the remaining elements.

5. Deque Operations: The C# version uses `LinkedList` methods like `Any()`, `First()`, `Last()`, `RemoveFirst()`, `RemoveLast()`, and `AddLast()`. The Java version uses `Deque` methods like `isEmpty()`, `peek()`, `peekLast()`, `removeFirst()`, `removeLast()`, and `addLast()`.
